# STAT 545A Assignment 1 Repository

This repository includes all files associated with UBC's STAT 545A first assignment, as compiled by Lucy Bellemare.

I am a first year Masters in Statistics, Biostatistics stream student. This is my first time living on the West Coast, so I'm excited to explore! I enjoy:

* Travel: I am currently planning trips to Victoria, Seattle, and Las Vegas
* Certain outdoors activities: hiking yes, skiing/swimming no.
* Going to concerts: super stoked to live in a city that bands actually visit! Hoping to see the following bands this semester:
    * Coheed and Cambria with Protest the Hero
    * Joyce Manor
    * Rise Against
    * Seether
    * Three Days Grace 
    * The Story So Far 
* Playing board games!

Please note: I got married this summer, and am in the process of changing my name. As such my git account is based on my new name *Lucy Mosquera*, but I am registered at UBC under my old name *Lucy Bellemare*. They are both me!
